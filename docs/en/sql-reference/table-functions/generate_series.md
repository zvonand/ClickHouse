# generate_series Table Function

Alias: `generateSeries`

## Syntax {#syntax}

Returns a table with the single 'generate_series' column (`UInt64`) that contains integers from start to stop inclusively:

```sql
generate_series(START, STOP)
```

Returns a table with the single 'generate_series' column (`UInt64`) that contains integers from start to stop inclusively with spacing between values given by `STEP`:

```sql
generate_series(START, STOP, STEP)
```

`STEP` can be negative, in which case the series is generated in descending order from `START` down to `STOP`. If `STEP` is negative and `START < STOP`, the result is empty.

## Examples {#examples}

The following queries return tables with the same content but different column names:

```sql
SELECT * FROM numbers(10, 5);
SELECT * FROM generate_series(10, 14);
```

And the following queries return tables with the same content but different column names (but the second option is more efficient):

```sql
SELECT * FROM numbers(10, 11) WHERE number % 3 == (10 % 3);
SELECT * FROM generate_series(10, 20, 3);
```

Generate a descending series:

```sql
SELECT * FROM generate_series(9, 0, -1);
```
